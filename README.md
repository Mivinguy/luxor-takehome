This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser if you run this locally. Otherwise, I have deployed the app here: [https://takehome-sigma.vercel.app](https://takehome-sigma.vercel.app/)

### How would you monitor the application to ensure it is running smoothly?
1. **Logging**: Implement logging throughout to record important events, errors, and performance metrics.
2. **Health Checks**: Set up health checks to monitor availability and responsiveness.
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor key performance metrics such as response time, throughput, and resource utilization.
4. **Error Tracking**: Implement error tracking to monitor and track application errors.

### How would you address scalability and performance?
1. **Database Optimization**: Optimize database queries, indexes, and schema design to ensure efficient data retrieval and storage. Utilize caching mechanisms, database sharding, or replication to distribute the workload and improve scalability.
2. **Caching**: Implement caching strategies at various levels of the application stack to reduce the load on the database.
3. **Horizontal Scaling**: Design the application architecture to support horizontal scaling by deploying multiple instances of the application behind a load balancer.
4. **Asynchronous Processing**: Offload time-consuming tasks and background processing to asynchronous queues or worker processes.
4. **Availability**: Utilize a CDN to increase availability and redundancy.

### Trade-offs you had to choose when doing this challenge (the things you would do different with more time and resources)
1. **Simplified Architecture**: Opted for a simpler architecture to minimize development time and complexity. This involved sacrificing certain features.
2. **No Testing Coverage**: This allowed for faster iteration and delivery but increases the risk of bugs.
3. **Temporary Solutions**: I implemented temporary or less scalable solutions to meet immediate needs, with plans to refactor or optimize them in the future as resources become available.

### With more time and resources, I would focus on:
1. **Comprehensive Testing**: Investing in unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, to ensure robustness and reliability across the application.
2. **Optimized Infrastructure**: Fine-tuning and optimizing the underlying infrastructure to improve performance, scalability, and reliability. This may involve optimizing resource utilization, implementing auto-scaling policies, and fine-tuning network configurations.
3. **User Experience Enhancements**: Iteratively improving the user experience based on feedback and usability testing. This may include refining the UI/UX design, optimizing page load times, and adding new features to enhance usability and engagement.
4. **Security Enhancements**: Strengthening the application's security posture by implementing additional security measures such as encryption, access controls, and vulnerability scanning. This helps protect against potential security threats and ensures data privacy and integrity.
